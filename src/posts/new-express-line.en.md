With the booming cross-border e-commerce industry, consumers are demanding faster and faster delivery times. To help Chinese sellers better expand into the North American market, Tanglog officially launches the new **"China-US Express Line"**.

## Service Highlights

### 1. Ultra-Fast: 3-5 Day Delivery
By establishing deep partnerships with core airlines, we have secured fixed cargo space on daily direct flights from Shenzhen and Shanghai to Los Angeles and New York. Combined with our self-operated trucking fleet in the US and last-mile courier accounts (UPS/FedEx), we achieve a lightning-fast experience of as little as **3 days** from shipment in China to delivery in the US. The average delivery time is stable at 3-5 working days.

### 2. Same-Day Flight
We implement a "Zero Retention" policy at our operation centers in Shenzhen and Shanghai. Cargo arriving in the morning is cleared by the afternoon and loaded onto flights that same evening. Our seamless process eliminates all unnecessary waiting times.

### 3. DDP Service: Worry-Free
This express line offers DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) service, including export customs declaration, US import clearance, and duty payment. Our professional customs team ensures clearance within 24 hours of landing, so sellers don't need to worry about complex tax and compliance issues.

## Ideal For

This express line is particularly suitable for the following types of cross-border sellers:
*   **Independent Brand Sellers**: Need an exceptional customer experience to drive repeat purchases.
