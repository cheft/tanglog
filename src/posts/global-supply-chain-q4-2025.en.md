## The Holiday Season Rush: Early Planning is Critical

As we approach the end of 2025, the global logistics sector is bracing for one of the busiest quarters in recent history. Retailers are stocking up earlier than usual to mitigate potential delays. Understanding the nuances of **shipping from China to the US** specifically for electronics and consumer goods has never been more important.

### Key Trends for High-Volume Routes

1. **Early Inventory Staging**: Companies are moving goods to forward warehouses in California and Texas.
2. **Air Freight Demand**: Routes like **Shenzhen (SZX) to Dallas (DFW)** are seeing 20% volume spikes.
3. **Last-Mile Innovation**: New drone delivery pilots in select US cities.

## Shipping Spotlights: Shenzhen & Yiwu

### Shenzhen to US (Electronics & High-Tech)

For clients shipping electronics from Shenzhen, **Air Freight** rates have stabilized but capacity is tightening.

- **Recommendation**: Book 5 days in advance for air cargo to ensure specific flight slots to LAX or JFK.
- **Cost Efficiency**: For batteries and sensitive electronics, our specialized DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) channels ensure compliance and speed.

### Yiwu to West Coast (Consumer Goods)

Small commodities from Yiwu generally move via Ocean Freight.

- **Consolidation**: We offer LCL (Less than Container Load) consolidation in Yiwu, perfect for small Amazon FBA sellers.
- **Transit Time**: Express Sea Freight to Long Beach is currently averaging 14-16 days.

## Port Situation & Amazon FBA

The West Coast ports have seen a 15% increase in throughput. While efficiency has improved, we advise booking at least 3 weeks in advance for Ocean Freight.
