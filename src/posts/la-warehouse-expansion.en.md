This is another major milestone in Tanglog's history! We are proud to announce that after months of meticulous preparation and construction, our new smart overseas warehouse in Anaheim, Los Angeles, is officially fully operational this week.

## Warehouse Overview

*   **Prime Location**: Adjacent to the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach, and only a 40-minute drive from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Our strategic location allows us to complete container pick-up and devanning with maximum speed.
*   **Massive Storage Space**: The total warehouse area reaches **30,000 square feet**, increasing storage capacity by **200%** over the previous facility.
*   **Multi-functional Zones**: Equipped with high-rack areas, oversized flat storage areas, temperature-controlled zones, and dedicated returns processing areas to meet diverse storage needs.

## Smart Upgrades

This expansion is not just about size, but a significant upgrade in capabilities. We have introduced brand-new smart equipment:

### 1. Automated Sorting Line
The new automatic sorting system can process **3,000+** packages per hour, with a sorting accuracy of 99.99%. This represents a qualitative leap in our dropshipping processing capability.

### 2. Full WMS Integration
Our WMS (Warehouse Management System) is synchronized in real-time with the OMS system used for shipments from China. Sellers can check inventory levels, order status, and return details in the backend at any time, achieving transparent and visualized inventory management.

### 3. AGV Robots
Introducing AGV robots to assist in picking has significantly shortened the walking path for workers, increasing picking efficiency by **40%**.

## Value for You

*   **Lower Logistics Costs**: Utilizing the overseas warehouse for bulk stocking significantly reduces per-unit logistics costs.
*   **Faster Delivery**: Shipping locally from the US means an average nationwide delivery of 2-3 days, greatly enhancing the buyer experience.
*   **Flexible Inventory Turnover**: Supporting a hybrid model of FBA forwarding and dropshipping helps you flexibly deal with Amazon storage limits.

The launch of Tanglog's new LA warehouse provides a stronger logistical backbone for your North American expansion. We welcome all new and existing clients to book a visit or inquire about warehousing services!
