In the context of global climate change, "Green Logistics" is no longer just a slogan but a mandatory course for every responsible company. As a leader in China-US cross-border logistics, Tanglog places sustainability at the core of its corporate strategy, committed to significantly reducing the environmental impact of logistics activities through technological innovation and management optimization.

## Our Environmental Initiatives

### 1. Smart Route Optimization
We utilize big data and AI algorithms to optimize cargo transport routes in real-time. By reducing empty load rates and avoiding congested routes, we have successfully improved our fleet's fuel efficiency by **15%**. This not only lowers transport costs but also significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

### 2. Biodegradable Packaging
Tanglog is fully implementing a "Plastic Reduction Action." In our operation centers, 90% of fillers have been replaced with biodegradable cornstarch pellets and recycled paper. We also actively promote the use of recyclable turnover boxes to our clients, reducing the consumption of single-use cardboard boxes.

### 3. Electric Fleet Pilot in North America
In 2023, we pioneered the introduction of the first batch of all-electric freight trucks in the Los Angeles area for "last-mile" delivery. These zero-emission, low-noise vehicles are ideal for eco-friendly urban delivery. We plan to increase the proportion of electric vehicles in our fleet to 40% over the next three years.

### 4. Paperless Operations
Through our self-developed Logistics Management System (LMS), we have achieved paperless operations from order placement and customs declaration to final delivery. The widespread use of electronic waybills and invoices saves tons of paper annually.

## Partnering for a Green Future

We believe that a green supply chain protects the environment and creates business value for our clients. More and more European and American consumers prefer eco-conscious brands. By choosing Tanglog's green logistics services, your brand image will be further enhanced.

Let us work together to leave a cleaner, better planet for the next generation.
