## Introduction

For Amazon sellers, logistics costs often account for more than 30% of total expenses. How can you minimize these costs while ensuring you never run out of stock? This article provides an in-depth analysis of the mainstream Amazon FBA inbound solutions in 2026.

### 1. The Speed King: International Express

If your goods are small in volume, high in value, or you need urgent replenishment to avoid a stockout, Express is the way to go.

- **Pros**: Door-to-door service, extremely fast (usually 2-4 business days), no need to worry about customs details.
- **Cons**: Most expensive option.
- **Best For**: New product testing, emergency replenishment.

### 2. The Efficiency Balance: Air + Delivery (Air Freight DDP)

Commonly known as "Air Freight DDP" or "Air Parcel." For shipments starting from **Shenzhen to USA**, this is our most popular choice. Compared to Express, its cost is lower while delivery times remain reliable.

- **Process**: Cargo is flown to major US gateway airports (e.g., LAX, ORD), cleared through customs, and then delivered to FBA warehouses via UPS/FedEx or truck.
- **Lead Time**: Usually 5-8 business days from **Shenzhen to Amazon FBA**.
- **Best For**: Medium to large parcels where timing is important but cost savings are desired.

### 3. The Cost Killer: Ocean Freight (LCL & FCL)

Ocean freight is the long-term solution for most seasoned sellers importing from **China to USA**.

- **Fast Boat (e.g., Matson)**: Transit time is about 15-20 days. It’s an exceptionally cost-effective choice for **Amazon FBA shipping**.
- **General Ocean Vessels (LCL/FCL)**: Transit time 25-35 days, suitable for massive volumes and non-time-sensitive goods like industrial parts or furniture.
- **Best For**: Large-scale inventory, well-planned regular sales products.

### The Necessity of DDP Services

In the current international trade environment, **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)** services have become essential. Loflog’s DDP channels cover all taxes and customs formalities—sellers just place the order, and we handle the rest.
